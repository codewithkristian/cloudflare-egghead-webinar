# Cloudflare

> Protect and accelerate your websites, apps, and teams.

---

# Cloudflare

> ~~Protect and accelerate your websites, apps, and teams.~~ 

> Use our servers around the world to make your life as a developer easier!

---

# Network basics

> **Origin**: a server, often located in a datacenter, that hosts your application

> **Client**: a user of your site, such as a human on a mobile phone, or another computer

> **The edge**: _Cloudflare's big advantage..._

---

# What is "the edge"?

![Cloudflare's edge network](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_Fy99PIFFym.png)

<figcaption>Cloudflare's 200+ edge servers around the world</figcaption>

---

# Each "edge" server will...

- Block malicious clients
- Optimize requests
- Secure your origin
- And more! (that's the purpose of this talk)

---

# Once you have an edge network infrastructure, there's a lot you can do for developers

---

# How we'll cover Cloudflare's products

## _(for developers)_

- Basics
- End-user tools
- Must-try
- Platform-defining

---

# Basics

## Things that you need to build web apps

- Analytics
- CDN/Caching
- DNS
- Firewall
- Registrar
- SSL

---

# Analytics

## **What is it:** free analytics for your domains

## **Pricing:** free

## **How it works:** analytics are automatically captured at the edge, and made available in the Cloudflare dashboard

---

# Analytics

![Analytics](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_pYdx9fIhql.png)

<figcaption>
  Request traffic

# Analytics

![Regional Analytics](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_zf3a4Lzw24.png)

<figcaption>
  Analytics by region
</figcaption>

---

# Web Analytics

## **What is it:** Google Analytics-like, privacy-first solution - **without needing to move your site to Cloudflare**

## **Pricing:** free

## **How it works:** embeddable JavaScript snippet that runs when your application is loaded in the client

---

# Web Analytics

---

# CDN/Caching

## **What is it:** Automatic caching on Cloudflare's edge servers for static assets

## **Pricing:** free

## **How it works:** automatically - no configuration required

---

# CDN/Caching

## Cached based on things like `Cache-Control` headers

![Cache stats](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_oUlrrwQzDT.png)

---

# DNS

## **What is it:** _Name resolution_ for your domains

## **Pricing:** free

## **How it works:** Cloudflare's nameservers resolve your domains, subdomains, and anything else - allowing you to set up custom domains, mail servers, and more

---

# How to set up Cloudflare DNS

## #1 - Point your domain's **nameservers** to Cloudflare

![Nameservers config](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_KoXmGOBNY0.png)

<figcaption>
  (Your domain's nameservers will be different)
</figcaption>

---

# How to set up Cloudflare DNS

## #2 - Add your domain to Cloudflare

![Add Site](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_4rvU5rwavg.png)

---

# How to set up Cloudflare DNS

## #3 - Configure your DNS records!

![DNS Records](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_v0kxaPQlan.png)

---

# Firewall

## **What is it:** Automatic firewall and _challenges_

## **Pricing:** free

## **How it works:** Cloudflare looks at incoming requests, and issues a Captcha if the client looks suspicious

---

# Firewall

![Challenge](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/image1.png)

<figcaption>Cloudflare challenge page</figcaption>

---

# Firewall

![Firewall logging](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_ZHxRxiuymM.png)

<figcaption>Firewall logging</figcaption>

---

# Registrar

## **What is it:** Domain transfers (and soon, registration) to Cloudflare

## **Pricing:** per domain

## **How it works:** Transfer domains to Cloudflare, and renew them at yearly prices much cheaper than other domain resellers

---

# Registrar

![Registrar transfer](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_c6eWvdOn7u.png)

<figcaption>Transferring existing domains to Cloudflare</figcaption>

---

# Registrar

- Free WHOIS protection ($xx/year saved on most providers)
- Priced based on wholesale domain charge (no mark-up)

---

# SSL

## **What is it:** Free encryption for web traffic to your domains

## **Pricing:** Free (!)

## **How it works:** Cloudflare encrypts traffic between our edge servers and your client, and more

---

# SSL

## SSL certificates used to be costly!

## Cloudflare made it free to run HTTPS on your site (this is why I signed up in the first place)

---

# SSL

![SSL Types](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/hykSe13czO.gif)

<figcaption>Progressive SSL encryption in Cloudflare's Dashboard</figcaption>

---

# "Progressive SSL encryption"
# Flexible, Full, Full (Strict)

## This allows you to do the important thing - **encrypt your user's connection** - and build better security between Cloudflare and your origin over time

---

# Must-try

## My favorite things in the ecosystem

- Workers
- Pages
- Cloudflare for Teams
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- Randomness Beacon
- Stream

---

# Workers

## **What is it:** Serverless functions

## **Pricing:** Free up to 100k requests/day, $0.50 per million requests/month

## **How it works:** Deploy serverless code to our servers, and we'll handle the rest

---

# Workers

- Approachable developer experience (DX) - service workers API, command-line first tooling
- Cool platform/runtime features 
- No hidden charges or pricing schemes

---

# Workers use-cases

## Authorization/authentication middleware
## Internationalization
## Serverless API
## Utility functions (connect to other SaaS tools)
## Full applications

---

# Built with Workers: Status Page

<div style={{ display: 'flex', marginTop: '2rem' }}>

# Built with Workers: uuid.rocks

```bash
$ curl https://uuid.rocks/plain # -> aba0e360-1e04-41b3-91a0-1f2263e1e0fb
```

- Generating UUIDs at the edge
- 19 million UUIDs generated at time of writing
- ~5ms response time*

# Built with Workers: Durable World

<TwitterTweetEmbed tweetId="1397577226087018499" options={{ align: 'center', width: 700 }} />

---

# Built with Workers: Durable World

- UI deployed with Cloudflare Pages (more on that in a bit!)
- Game state stored with Durable Objects
- Game state synced between frontend UI and Workers with WebSockets

---

# Workers Platform

- Cache API
- HTMLRewriter
- Scheduled Workers
- WebSockets
- Workers KV
- Workers Durable Objects

---

# Cache API

## Manage the Cloudflare Cache from inside a Worker

```js
async function handleRequest(event) {
  const cacheKey = new Request(event.request.url.toString(), event.request)
  const cache = caches.default

  let response = await cache.match(cacheKey)

  if (!response) {
    response = await fetch(event.request)
    event.waitUntil(cache.put(cacheKey, response.clone()))
  }
  return response
}
```

---

# HTMLRewriter

## Streaming HTML parser and rewriter

```js
const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter()
  .on("a", new HTTPSRewriter())

class HTTPSRewriter {
  element(element) {
    if (element.getAttribute("href")) {
      element.setAttribute("href", attribute.replace("http", "https"))
    }
  }
}

async function handleRequest(req) {
  return rewriter.transform(await fetch(req)
}
```

---

# Scheduled Workers
## Run your Workers every hour, every day, etc.

![Cron Triggers](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/workers-schedule-editor.png)

---

# WebSockets

## Build real-time usecases in your Workers functions

![Websockets Demo](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/DN9OV3Phwc.gif)

---

# Workers KV

## Distributed key-value store - **no database needed!**

```js
await STORE.put("user-1", JSON.stringify({ id: 1, name: "Kristian" }))

// Some time later...

const user = await STORE.get("user-1", { type: "json" })
console.log(user) // { id: 1, name: "Kristian" }
```

---

# Workers Durable Objects

## Always-consistent, addressable Worker that can store data & state

---

# Workers KV versus Workers Durable Objects

| Tool | Consistency | Suited for |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Workers KV | Eventual | Reads |
| Workers Durable Objects | Always | Writes |

---

# Pages

- Rock-solid performance at the edge
- Deploy previews + access management
- Unlimited sites, requests, and bandwidth

---

# Deploy previews
## Shareable URLs for every commit and pull request

![Deploy previews](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_kg14XUrXo2.png)

---

# Access management
## Fine-grained permissions for accessing your site

![Access management](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_aoiqcXvdGT.png)

---

# Pages + Workers
## Serverless functions won't just live alongside your applications... they can run _before_ your applications

---

# We can continue to build more powerful use-cases with this combo

- "Edge-side" rendering at the edge
- Personalization/region-based customization
- Low-latency utility functions for things like payments and authentication
- the future??? 🤯
